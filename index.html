        <h2>Bash Scripting Fundamentals</h2>
        <article>
          <h3>Script Structure</h3>
          <p>Bash scripts begin with a shebang line (<code>#!/bin/bash</code>) which tells the system which interpreter to use. Scripts can include commands, variables, and control structures to automate tasks efficiently.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3>Variables and Data Types</h3>
          <p>In Bash, variables are used to store data, whether it be strings or numbers. Variables are untyped by default and are defined simply by assigning a value: <code>variable=value</code>. Understanding variables is crucial for effective scripting.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3>Control Structures</h3>
          <p>Control structures like <code>if</code> statements, <code>for</code> loops, <code>while</code> loops, and <code>case</code> statements allow you to control the flow of your script. These structures are key to handling decision-making and repetition in your code.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3>Functions</h3>
          <p>Functions enable you to group and reuse code within your scripts. They help in keeping your scripts organized and maintainable by encapsulating complex tasks into simple callable blocks.</p>

        <h2>Advanced Bash Topics</h2>
        <article>
          <h3>Pipes and Redirection</h3>
          <p>Pipes (<code>|</code>) allow you to pass the output of one command as input to another, while redirection operators (<code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>) help manage input and output streams. These are powerful tools for chaining commands together.</p>

        <article>
          <h3>Regular Expressions and Pattern Matching</h3>
          <p>Regular expressions in Bash enable you to search, match, and manipulate text efficiently. Mastering pattern matching is essential for text processing tasks.</p>
